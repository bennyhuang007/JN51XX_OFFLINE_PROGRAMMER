<1>USB Mode:
1)disconnect USB and external DC power
2)press the buttom then connet to PC with USB,now a mass storage device available on PC
you can put the config.ini target.bin and mac.bin(optional and the file name can change in config.ini) into mass storage,also you can get log file(e.g. log.txt,defined in config.ini).

<2>Programmer Mode:
1)DO NOT press the buttom,connet USB or external DC power.
2)after short time self check,all LED will turn to green.if any is red,please see <6> and log file for more information.
3)connet the chip to programmer
4)press the buttom,the corresponding LED will turn to yellow,if the LED turn to green,the chip is programed;if LED turn to RED,it mean failure,see the log file(if enable) define in config.ini for more information.
